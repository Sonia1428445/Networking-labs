## Description

In this repository, you'll find a series of networking lab that I've undertaken as part of my journey to become proficient in networking technologies. These projects cover a wide range of topics, including subnetting, VLAN configuration, routing protocols(static and dynamic), and network security, Protocols like EIGRP and OSPF, Vlan trunking protocol, switching etc.

For each project, you'll find detailed documentation, code, and configuration files that highlight the following:

- **Objective:** A repository cleary defining the practice i have done in CISCO pracket tracer.
- **Technologies Used:** I have used networking tools in CISCO are Router, Switch, PC, and other devices available in CISCO.
- **Implementation:**
- Open your software you have downloaded like , i did my all implementations in CISCO.
- Choose the Router 2621*M and Switch 2950T from the devices.
- connect Router and Switch to the PC with the cable.
- Go the router and add the commands in the configuration Desktop.
- Give the network address to the router according to the protocol you are using that is dynamic or static.
- Or use the protocol like EIGRP and OSPF.
- GIve the IP's to the PC's and ping the network to the other network and check connection.
- **Challenges Faced:** Sometimes your connection is lost, and you have to check the all commands on the router, that is the difficult to handle sometimes because if in case your connection is not connected you have to make the lab again.
- **Outcomes:**
- You will learn how to connect the LAN, WAN, MAN, PAN network.
- You will learn the commands to run the network that works on cmd.
- It is the overview to connect the network in reel Life.

Feel free to explore the individual project folders for more in-depth information. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always eager to learn and improve my networking skills!
